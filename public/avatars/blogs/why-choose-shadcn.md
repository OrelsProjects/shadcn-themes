# Why choose Shadcn UI

## 1. Key Highlights

- **Customizable Components**  
  You’re not stuck with rigid defaults. Every component is ready for you to re-style or extend, so you never have to wrestle with hardcoded layouts.

- **No External Dependencies**  
  Fewer moving parts mean fewer clashes with other libraries. You won’t be at the mercy of third-party updates or version conflicts that can plague larger frameworks.

- **Theming System**  
  Define and switch between light or dark themes seamlessly. You keep full control of colors, spacing, and typography—right down to the last pixel.

   Rapid prototyping is easier with modular components. You only import what you need, keeping bundle sizes lean and development speed high.

2. **Accessibility-Focused Projects**  
   Shadcn UI meets modern accessibility standards without sacrificing design. If you prioritize inclusivity, this library has you covered right out of the box.

## 3. Potential Drawbacks
- **Smaller Community**  
  While documentation is growing, it’s still not as large as established libraries. You might have to rely on direct code exploration or community forums for troubleshooting.
- **Learning Curve**  
  The high flexibility is a double-edged sword. If your team prefers strict guidelines, expect a bit of upfront ramp-up time.
